        API Documentation
      %p
        This is the official documentation to <strong>retrieve</strong> informations on files and <strong>upload</strong> files to Dietwater File Hosting. The API is built upon the <code>JSON</code> file format: for whatever client you choose to make requests with, it must support <code>JSON</code>. Examples in this documentation will use <code>curl</code>, a program included in almost all modern Linux distributions.

        A GET request on this collection gathers all files on the front page as a single object with each attributes, a number starting from 0, paired to a file object, with its attributes. Its attributes are explained below. Here's an example of a request and its response:<br/>
        <code>$ curl -X GET -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://files.dietwatr.com/api/files</code><br/>
        <pre><code>
          |{

          |    "frontpage": true,

        Explanation of each attributes of a file:
        %dl
          %dt -> <code>filename</code>
          %dd -> Autogenerated filename combining its <code>unique_id</code> and its extension
          %dt -> <code>unique_id</code>
          %dd -> Autogenerated unique ID, is used for its specific URL
      %h4 -> POST
      %p
        Sending a POST request to this collection uploads a new file, either to the front page or privately. However, some attributes must be supplied:
        %dl
          %dt -> <code>aaaa</code>
          %dd -> what is
          %dt -> <code>file</code>
          %dd -> The file that must be uploaded. It must be encoded in base64.
        Here's an example of a POST request containing the file and its supplied attributes and the response:<br/>
        <code>$ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://files.dietwatr.com/api/files</code>
      %h2 -> Requests on a single file
      %h4 -> GET
